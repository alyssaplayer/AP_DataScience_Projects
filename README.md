# AP_DataScience_Projects
This repository holds general-purpose Python scripts that focus on automation, image processing, and algorithm practice outside of my typical academic workflow. 

For my Programming Fundamentals final project, I conducted an end-to-end data analysis on an unseen dataset. I used scatter matrices to uncover correlations before testing three different regression models—Linear, Decision Tree, and Ridge—to determine the most accurate predictive approach.

The Colour Palette script automatically extracts a colour palette from any image using the K-Means clustering algorithm. It includes an added accessibility function recommending whether the supporting font should be black or white.
